Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Rob, and I built Best Husband Ever because I needed it myself.

I realized I wasn't being the partner I wanted to be. I'd get defensive. I'd wait to be asked to help. I'd forget to express appreciation. Sound familiar?

I looked for daily, actionable ways to be better. Not grand gestures. Not expensive gifts. Just small, consistent actions that show I care.

I couldn't find what I was looking for. So I built it.

Best Husband Ever is my attempt to make being a great husband easier, more fun, and more consistent. It's daily actions, not just advice. It's gamification that actually matters.

If you're here, you probably want the same thing I do: to be a better partner, to bring more joy to your marriage, and to make your family dynamic stronger.

I'd love your feedback, questions, and support. Let's do this together. 💪

- Rob
