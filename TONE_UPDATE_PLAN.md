# Tone Update Plan - Injecting "Old Spice" Energy

## Where to Start (Priority Order)

### 1. Dashboard Headlines ⭐ (HIGHEST IMPACT)
**Current**: "Tomorrow's Action" + "One concrete step to level up your marriage game."
**New Voice**: More confident, playful, direct
**Why First**: User sees this daily. Wife might see it.

### 2. Email Copy ⭐ (WIFE SEES THIS)
**Current**: Very corporate, safe
**New Voice**: Confident storytelling, fun, memorable
**Why Second**: She might see these emails. Should make her think "Aww, he's trying!"

### 3. Challenge Success Modal 🎯 (CELEBRATION MOMENT)
**Current**: Generic "Challenge Joined!"
**New Voice**: Energetic, fun celebration that feels like an achievement

### 4. Challenge Descriptions 📝 (FIRST IMPRESSION)
**Current**: "Focus on rebuilding communication..."
**New Voice**: Storytelling, confident, playful but real

### 5. Error Modal (MINOR)
Keep it friendly but make it feel less corporate

## Sample Copy Updates

### Dashboard Headline Options:
1. "Tomorrow's Mission" (simple, confident)
2. "Tomorrow You Win" (direct, fun)
3. "Your Daily Win" (ownership, confidence)

### Dashboard Subtitle Options:
1. "One concrete move. One wife smile. You got this." (storytelling, fun)
2. "Small action, big reaction. Let's do this." (confident, direct)
3. "Your move, chief. Here's how to make tomorrow count." (playful, manly)

### Email Subject Options:
1. "Tomorrow: Make Her Day (It Takes 5 Minutes)"
2. "Tomorrow's Mission: Wife-Appreciation Mode Activated"
3. "Newsflash: Tomorrow You Win. Here's How."

## Recommendation: Start with Dashboard + Email

These are:
- Most visible daily
- Wife might see them
- Set the tone for everything else
- Easy to test and iterate
