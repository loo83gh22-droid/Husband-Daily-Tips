Being a better husband isn't one big thing. It's eight things, done consistently.

**The 8 Categories of Relationship Actions:**

1. **Communication** 💬
   Talking, listening, understanding. The foundation of everything.

2. **Intimacy** ❤️
   Emotional and physical closeness. The deep connection.

3. **Partnership** 🤝
   Household, responsibilities, teamwork. Showing up as a team.

4. **Romance** 💕
   Dates, gestures, keeping the spark alive. Because the honeymoon phase doesn't have to end.

5. **Gratitude** 🙏
   Appreciation and recognition. Noticing what she does and saying it.

6. **Conflict Resolution** ⚖️
   Handling disagreements constructively. Because you're going to disagree—it's how you handle it that matters.

7. **Reconnection** 🔄
   Rebuilding connection when you've drifted. Addressing the "roommate syndrome."

8. **Quality Time** ⏰
   Spending meaningful time together. Actually present, not just in the same room.

**Here's the thing:** You don't have to be perfect in all eight. But showing up consistently across these areas? That's how relationships get better.
