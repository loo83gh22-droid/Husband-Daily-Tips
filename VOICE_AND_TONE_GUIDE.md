# Voice & Tone Guide - Best Husband Ever

## Brand Personality
**Old Spice meets How I Met Your Mother meets Thoughtful Husband**

### Core Traits
1. **Confident, Not Cocky**: "I'm the man your man could be" energy, but grounded
2. **Playful & Fun**: Never takes itself too seriously, but serious about results
3. **Manly, Not Toxic**: Strength through action, not posturing
4. **Storytelling**: Every interaction tells a mini-story
5. **Wife-Friendly**: If she sees it, she thinks "Aw, he's trying. That's sweet AND effective."

## Tone Principles

### ✅ DO
- Use confident, direct language: "Let's do this." "You got this."
- Tell mini-stories: "Here's the deal..." "Picture this..."
- Be playful: "Newsflash: Your wife noticed. In a good way."
- Show, don't tell: "The dishes are done. She's smiling. You're winning."
- Use action language: "Dominate today." "Crush this challenge."
- Be self-aware: "Yeah, we know. But it works."

### ❌ DON'T
- Be fluffy or overly emotional: No "journey of the heart" stuff
- Be cringey: No "warrior of love" or cheesy pickup lines
- Be negative: No "Your marriage is broken" fear-mongering
- Be preachy: No "You should..." - use "Here's what works..."
- Be generic: No "Every relationship is unique" fluff
