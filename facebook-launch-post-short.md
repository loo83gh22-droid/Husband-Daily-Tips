# Facebook Launch Post (Shorter Version)

**Hey friends! 👋**

I've been building something I'm genuinely excited about, and I'd love your support as we launch.

**Best Husband Ever** - A daily action app that helps husbands actually show up in their relationships. No grand gestures. Just small, consistent actions that make a real difference.

You sign up, take a quick survey, and get personalized daily actions delivered to your inbox. Things like "Listen without fixing" or "Take over the morning routine completely." Simple stuff. But the consistency? That's where the magic happens.

**I'm looking for three types of supporters:**

**1. Free Supporter** 🆓
Sign up, start your 7-day free trial, and see if it works for you. Convert if you love it, or stay free and help us grow.

**2. Test Supporter** 🧪
You're active, give honest feedback (surveys and occasional messages—not daily!), and commit for at least 90 days. In return? **Free access for life.**

**3. Paid Supporter** 💪
You're already a fan, want to support a friend, and you're ready to jump in. Your subscription helps us keep building.

**WIVES! 👋** 
This could be a great gift for your husband. 😉 It's all in good fun, but with real upside for your relationship.

**What you get:**
- Daily personalized actions
- Weekly planning actions
- Progress tracking (Husband Health score, streaks, badges)
- Private journal & Team Wins section
- How-to guides for every action
- 7-day free trial (no credit card required)

**The goal:** Make it easier for husbands to show up consistently. Small daily actions. Big relationship impact.

Thanks for being part of this journey, friends. Your support—in any form—means the world.

*P.S. - Test Supporters, shoot me a DM for lifetime access setup. Paid Supporters, thank you for believing in this. Just curious? Sign up for free and see what it's all about.*
