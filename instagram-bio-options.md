## 🎯 My Top 3 Recommendations

1. **Option 1** - Best balance of clarity, benefit, and call-to-action
2. **Option 2** - Uses your tagline "Stop winging it. Start winning it" which is memorable
3. **Option 6** - Most relatable and authentic tone

## 📝 Notes

- **Link in bio**: Instagram doesn't allow clickable links in bios, so always reference "Link in bio" or "besthusbandever.com"
- **Emojis**: Use 1-2 strategically. Too many looks unprofessional.
- **Line breaks**: Use them for readability (Instagram supports them)
- **Call-to-action**: Always include one (Free trial, Link in bio, etc.)
- **Character limit**: 150 characters max (including spaces and emojis)
