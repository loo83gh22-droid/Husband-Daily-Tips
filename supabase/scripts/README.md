# Supabase Utility Scripts

This folder contains utility scripts that are not part of the migration sequence.

## Scripts

- **`reset_challenges.sql`** - Utility script to reset user challenges (for testing/debugging)
- **`verify_rls_enabled.sql`** - Verification query to check if Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on tables

These scripts should be run manually when needed, not as part of the standard migration process.
