# Complete Product Hunt Launch Guide

## 🎯 What is Product Hunt?

Product Hunt is a platform where people discover new products. It's like "Hacker News for products." Getting featured on Product Hunt can drive thousands of visitors to your site in a single day.

**Key Facts:**
- Products are ranked by upvotes within a 24-hour period
- Top products get featured on the homepage
- Can drive 1,000-10,000+ visitors in one day
- Great for early traction and press coverage

## 🚫 Why You Can't Post Your Own Product

**Product Hunt Rule**: Makers (the people who built the product) cannot post their own products. You need someone else to "hunt" it for you.

**Why?** This prevents self-promotion spam and keeps the community authentic.

## 👥 Step 1: Find a Hunter

A "hunter" is someone with a Product Hunt account who will post your product for you.

### Where to Find Hunters:

**Option 1: Ask Friends/Network**
- Do you know anyone active on Product Hunt?
- Ask friends, colleagues, or people in your network
- Best if they have some Product Hunt karma (upvotes on their profile)

**Option 2: Product Hunt Community**
- Join Product Hunt's Slack community
- Post in #hunters channel asking for help
- Be genuine and explain your product

**Option 3: Twitter/X**
- Search for "Product Hunt hunter" or "PH hunter"
- Look for people who've hunted products before
- Reach out politely explaining your product

**Option 4: Indie Hackers / Reddit**
- Post on r/indiehackers or r/SideProject
- Ask if anyone would be willing to hunt your product
- Offer to return the favor

**Option 5: Hire a Hunter**
- Some people offer hunting services (usually $50-200)
- Search "Product Hunt hunter for hire"
- Make sure they have good karma and reviews

### What to Look for in a Hunter:
- ✅ Active Product Hunt account
- ✅ Some karma (upvotes they've received)
- ✅ Has hunted products before (check their profile)
- ✅ Responsive and reliable
- ✅ Understands your product

## 📅 Step 3: Choose Your Launch Date

**Best Days**: Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday

**Best Time**: 12:01 AM PST (Pacific Standard Time)
