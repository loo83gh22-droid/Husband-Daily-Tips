# Copy Refresh Proposal - Old Spice Energy Injection

## Where to Start (Based on Impact + Wife-Friendliness)

### 🎯 PRIORITY 1: Dashboard Headlines (Daily Visibility)
**Current State:**
- "Tomorrow's Action"
- "One concrete step to level up your marriage game."

**Proposed Options:**

**Option A - Confident & Direct:**
- Headline: "Tomorrow's Mission"
- Subtitle: "One concrete move. One wife smile. You got this."

**Option B - Playful & Fun:**
- Headline: "Tomorrow You Win"
- Subtitle: "Small action, big reaction. Here's how."

**Option C - Storytelling (HIMYM style):**
- Headline: "Tomorrow's Action"
- Subtitle: "Here's the deal: One move today. Wife notices tomorrow. Legend status achieved."

### 📧 PRIORITY 2: Email Copy (Wife Might See)
**Current Email Subject:**
- "Tomorrow's Action: Express Gratitude"

**Proposed Subjects:**
1. "Tomorrow: Make Her Smile (It Takes 5 Minutes)"
2. "Newsflash: Tomorrow You Win. Here's Your Move."
3. "Tomorrow's Mission: Wife-Appreciation Mode Activated"

**Current Email Body:** Very corporate, safe

**Proposed Opening:**
Instead of: "We're sending tomorrow's action today at 12pm so you have time to plan..."

Try: "Here's the deal: Tomorrow's action arrives today. Why? Because winners plan ahead, and that's what you're becoming. Plus, it gives you time to actually make it happen—no scrambling, no forgetting, just execution."

### 🎉 PRIORITY 3: Challenge Success Modal (Celebration Moment)
**Current:** "Challenge Joined!" + Generic message

**Proposed:**
- Title: "Boom. You're In. 🎯"
- Subtitle: "7 days. 7 chances to level up. Your wife notices in 3... 2... 1..."
- Body: More energetic, playful celebration

### 📝 PRIORITY 4: Challenge Descriptions (First Impression)
**Current Communication Challenge:**
"Focus on rebuilding communication and connection. Each day includes a specific action to improve how you talk and listen to each other."

**Proposed:**
"7 days. 7 chances to stop talking AT her and start talking WITH her. Real conversations, not surface-level stuff. The guy who listens? That's the guy who wins. Let's upgrade your conversation game."

## Wife-Friendliness Check

Every option passes: ✅
- Shows genuine effort
- Confident but not cocky
- Fun but not cringey
- Thoughtful but not fluffy
- She'd think: "Aww, he's actually trying. And it's working."

## Recommendation

**Start with Dashboard + Email** because:
1. Most visible daily
2. Wife might see them
3. Sets tone for everything else
4. Easy to iterate based on feedback

**Which direction do you prefer?**
- **A)** Confident & Direct ("Tomorrow's Mission")
- **B)** Playful & Fun ("Tomorrow You Win")
- **C)** Storytelling ("Here's the deal...")
- **D)** Mix of all three (different contexts)
