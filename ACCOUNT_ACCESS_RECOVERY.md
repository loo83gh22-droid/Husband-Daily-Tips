## Important Notes

⚠️ **I cannot access your accounts** - I don't have passwords or the ability to reset them.

✅ **Password reset links** are sent to: `waterloo1983hawk22@gmail.com`

🔐 **Security**: Never share passwords with anyone, including me.

📧 **Check your email** - All reset links go to your registered email address.

## Which Account Do You Need Access To?

The most critical ones are likely:
1. **Vercel** - For deployments (site is live at besthusbandever.com)
2. **Supabase** - For database access (to run migrations, check data)
3. **GitHub** - For code repository (less critical if you have local access)

## Quick Access Check

- ✅ **GitHub**: Repository is at https://github.com/loo83gh22-droid/Husband-Daily-Tips
- ✅ **Vercel**: Site is live, deployments are working
- ✅ **Supabase**: Database is running, RLS is enabled

If deployments are working, **Vercel is likely accessible via GitHub integration**.

## Next Steps

1. Try password reset for the account you need
2. Check email (including spam) for reset links
3. Try "Sign in with GitHub" if available (for Vercel/Supabase)
4. If all else fails, contact support for that service

Let me know which account(s) you need help accessing and I can provide more specific guidance!
