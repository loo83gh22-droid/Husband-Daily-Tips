## Logical Flow

1. **User visits dashboard** → Gets assigned a **Tip** (general guidance)
   - Example: "Express Gratitude"

2. **User browses Actions page** → Can choose specific **Actions** to complete
   - Example: "Gratitude List" (List 5 things you're grateful for)
   - Example: "Gratitude Text" (Send a gratitude text)

3. **User completes Actions** → Earns badges, boosts health bar

4. **Tips provide the "why"** → Actions provide the "how"

---

## Summary

- **Tips** = "You should express gratitude" (educational/guidance)
- **Actions** = "List 5 things you're grateful for" (specific task)

Tips are like reading advice from a relationship book.
Actions are like doing exercises from a workbook.
