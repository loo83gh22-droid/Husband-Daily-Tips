## WHY: The Problem & Solution

### The Problem

#### Relationship Decline is Real
- **50% of marriages end in divorce** (US statistics)
- Many more relationships exist in a state of "quiet desperation"
- Couples drift apart gradually, often without realizing it
- Communication breaks down, intimacy fades, partners become roommates

#### Why Men Don't Get Help
- **Therapy stigma**: "I don't need therapy, I'm fine"
- **Cost barriers**: $100-200+ per session, often not covered by insurance
- **Time constraints**: Scheduling appointments, travel time
- **Lack of awareness**: Don't recognize problems until crisis
- **No structure**: Want to improve but don't know where to start
- **Accountability gap**: Easy to make promises, hard to follow through

#### The "Roommate Syndrome"
- Partners coexist but don't connect
- Conversations are transactional ("Did you pay the electric bill?")
- Romance and intentionality fade
- Taking each other for granted
- Lost the spark that brought them together

### The Solution

**Best Husband Ever provides:**
1. **Accessibility**: Available 24/7, no appointments needed
2. **Affordability**: $7/month vs. $400-800/month for therapy
3. **Anonymity**: Private, no stigma, no judgment
4. **Actionability**: Daily, specific steps, not abstract advice
5. **Accountability**: Gamification, streaks, badges create motivation
6. **Personalization**: Tailored to your relationship needs
7. **Prevention**: Small daily investments prevent major issues
8. **Structure**: Clear path from where you are to where you want to be

### Value Proposition
**"Level up your biggest win—your relationship—for less than the cost of a coffee per day."**

- **ROI**: One good action can save a relationship worth thousands in therapy or divorce costs
- **Convenience**: 5-15 minutes daily, fits into existing routine
- **Proven approach**: Based on relationship counseling principles, made accessible
- **Measurable progress**: Health score, badges, streaks show real improvement
