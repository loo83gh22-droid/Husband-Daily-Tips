**Subject**: Password Reset Email Not Arriving - Need Manual Password Reset

**Description**:

Hello Auth0 Support,

I'm unable to receive password reset emails for my user account and need assistance regaining access.

**Tenant/Domain**: `dev-m8ch7cyvv1dedzwf`
**Application**: Best Husband Ever
**User Email**: `waterloo1983hawk22@gmail.com`
**Issue**: Password reset emails are not arriving when I click "Forgot password?" on the login screen

**What I've tried**:
- Clicked "Forgot password?" multiple times
- Checked email inbox, spam, junk, and all folders
- Waited several hours between attempts
- Verified email address is correct

**Request**:
Could you please either:
1. Manually reset my password and send me a new temporary password, OR
2. Investigate why password reset emails aren't being delivered to my email address

Thank you for your help!
