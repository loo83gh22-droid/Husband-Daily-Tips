```

### Post 3: Personal Story
```
A while ago, I had what I call my "Husband Wake-Up Call."

I thought we were discussing dinner plans. She thought we were having a deep emotional conversation.

We were NOT on the same page.

That's when I realized: I had no idea what I was doing. I was trying my best, but "trying my best" wasn't cutting it.

So I teamed up with a buddy, and we built something to help.

Because we're not relationship experts. We're just two regular guys who wanted to be better husbands.

What was your wake-up call? Share your story below.
