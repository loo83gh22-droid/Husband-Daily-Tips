### Post 4: Personal Story
**Image:** 1080x1080px square
- Can be text-based or simple illustration
- Focus on authenticity

**Caption:**
```
A while ago, I had what I call my "Husband Wake-Up Call."

I thought we were discussing dinner plans. She thought we were having a deep emotional conversation.

We were NOT on the same page.

That's when I realized: I had no idea what I was doing. I was trying my best, but "trying my best" wasn't cutting it.

So I teamed up with a buddy, and we built something to help.

Because we're not relationship experts. We're just two regular guys who wanted to be better husbands.

What was your wake-up call? Share your story below.

- Supporting text about daily actions

**Caption:**
```
Why small daily actions beat grand gestures every time:

✅ They're sustainable
✅ They show consistent effort
✅ They compound over time
✅ They're more meaningful
✅ They're actually doable

You don't need to rent a hot air balloon. You just need to show up, consistently, in small ways.
