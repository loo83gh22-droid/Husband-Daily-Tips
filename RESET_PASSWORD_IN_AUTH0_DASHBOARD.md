# Reset User Password Directly in Auth0 Dashboard

## Since You Have Access to Auth0 Dashboard, You Can Reset the Password Manually!

### Steps to Reset Password in Auth0:

1. **In Auth0 Dashboard**, look at the left sidebar
2. **Click**: "User Management" (usually near the bottom)
3. **Click**: "Users" (under User Management)
4. **Search** for: `waterloo1983hawk22@gmail.com`
5. **Click** on that user to open their profile
6. **Look for**: "Actions" button or dropdown (usually in top right of user page)
7. **Click**: "Change Password" or "Reset Password"
8. **Set**: A new temporary password
9. **Click**: "Save" or "Reset"

**OR**:

1. On the user profile page, look for a **"Password"** section
2. There should be a **"Change Password"** or **"Reset Password"** button
3. Click it and set a new password

### Alternative: Delete and Recreate User (Last Resort)

If the above doesn't work:

1. In User Management → Users
2. Find your user
3. Delete the user account
4. When you try to sign up again, Auth0 will create a new account
5. **⚠️ WARNING**: This will lose all your data in your app (actions, badges, etc.)

**Better Option**: Just reset the password in Auth0 dashboard - that's the cleanest solution!

### After Resetting Password:

1. Go back to https://besthusbandever.com
2. Click "Sign In"
3. Enter: `waterloo1983hawk22@gmail.com`
4. Enter: The new password you just set in Auth0
5. You should be logged in!
