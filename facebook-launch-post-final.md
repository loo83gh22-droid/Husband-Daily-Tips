# Facebook Launch Post (Final Version)

---

**Hey friends! 👋**

I've been working on something I'm genuinely excited about, and I'd love your support as we launch.

**Best Husband Ever** - A daily action app that helps husbands (like me) actually show up in their relationships. No grand gestures. No "what do you want to do?" conversations. Just small, consistent actions that make a real difference.

**The idea:** You sign up, take a quick survey, and then get personalized daily actions delivered to your inbox. Things like "Listen without fixing" or "Take over the morning routine completely." Simple stuff. But the consistency? That's where the magic happens.

**Why I'm building this:** Because I've learned that showing up consistently—even in small ways—transforms relationships. And honestly? Most of us need a little help remembering to do that.

**Here's where you come in:**

I'm looking for **three types of supporters** to help us launch:

**1. Free Supporter** 🆓
Sign up, start your 7-day free trial, and see if it works for you. Convert to paid if you love it, or stay free and help us grow. Either way, you're part of building something that could help a lot of relationships.

**2. Test Supporter** 🧪
You're active, you give honest feedback (through surveys and occasional messages—not daily!), and you're committed for at least 90 days. In return? **Free access for life.** You're helping us build this right, and we want to make sure you're taken care of.

**3. Paid Supporter** 💪
You're already a fan of what we're doing, you want to support a friend, and you're ready to jump in. Your subscription helps us keep building and improving. Plus, you get all the premium features from day one.

**WIVES! 👋** 
This could be a great gift for your husband. 😉 It's all in good fun, but with real upside for your relationship. And honestly? If he's willing to try something like this, that's already a good sign.

**What you get:**
- Daily personalized actions (delivered at 12 noon in your timezone)
- Weekly planning actions for bigger gestures
- Progress tracking (Husband Health score, streaks, badges)
- Private journal to log your wins
- Team Wins section to share completed actions
- How-to guides for every action
- 7-day free trial (no credit card required)

**The goal:** Make it easier for husbands to show up consistently. Small daily actions. Big relationship impact.

Thanks for being part of this journey, friends. Your support—in any form—means the world.

*P.S. - If you're a Test Supporter, shoot me a DM and we'll get you set up with lifetime access. If you're a Paid Supporter, thank you for believing in this. And if you're just curious? Sign up for free and see what it's all about.*
